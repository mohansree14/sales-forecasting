# sales-forecasting
Project Description: This project uses regression and time series analysis to forecast sales for a company. The data used for the project is historical sales data for the company. The regression model is used to predict the sales for the next time period, while the time series model is used to predict the sales for the next few time periods.

Project Goals: The goals of this project are to:

Learn how to use regression and time series analysis to forecast sales
Build a model that can accurately predict sales
Evaluate the performance of the model
Project Methods: The methods used in this project are:

Data cleaning
Exploratory data analysis
Regression analysis
Time series analysis
Model evaluation
Project Results: The results of this project show that the regression model can accurately predict sales for the next time period. The time series model can also accurately predict sales for the next few time periods. However, the time series model is more accurate than the regression model.

Project Conclusion: The conclusion of this project is that regression and time series analysis can be used to forecast sales. The time series model is more accurate than the regression model, but both models can be used to get a good estimate of future sales.

Project Files: The project files include the following:

A Jupyter notebook that contains the code for the project
A README file that describes the project
A data file that contains the historical sales data
Project Instructions: To run the project, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can then download the project files and open the Jupyter notebook. The notebook will walk you through the steps of the project.
